📓 My coding notes! Currently in the form of OneNote packages. As this is still a work-in-progress (learning never ends, after all) note groups that are complete are denoted with a check mark.
There is also a LinkedIn Assessments section that just has the requirements for the tests on it; I also have C and C++ notes but those are primarily class notes lol so I have to find out if sharing slides is allowed.
